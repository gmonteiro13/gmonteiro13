### Hi there, I'm Gabriel ðŸ‘‹

My goal for 2022 is to work on as many projects as possible, using different techs.
You may think that I'm not focused, but I no longer limit myself when it comes to knowledge. Learning has been my passion since I started remembering stuff and I hope to keep it that way! :)
